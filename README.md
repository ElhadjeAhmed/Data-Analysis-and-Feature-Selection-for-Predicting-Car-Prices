This project applies data analysis techniques to explore a used car dataset and identify the most important features that influence car prices.

The workflow includes:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the dataset through statistics and visualizations.

Feature Engineering & Selection: Creating new features (e.g., car age), encoding categorical variables, and determining which features contribute the most to price prediction.

Modeling: Training a Linear Regression model to predict car prices using the selected features.

Evaluation: Measuring performance and analyzing how feature selection impacts prediction accuracy.

The goal of this project is to showcase data analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning skills for real-world price prediction tasks.
