# 🚗 Data Analysis and Feature Selection for Predicting Car Prices

This project applies **data analysis techniques** to explore a used car dataset and identify the most important features that influence car prices.  

---

## 📊 Workflow

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Understanding the dataset through summary statistics and visualizations.  
   - Handling missing values and outliers.  

2. **Feature Engineering & Selection**  
   - Creating new features (e.g., `car_age`).  
   - Encoding categorical variables (Label Encoding / One-Hot Encoding).  
   - Selecting the most important features for price prediction.  

3. **Modeling**  
   - Training a **Linear Regression model** on the processed dataset.  
   - Comparing model performance before and after feature selection.  

4. **Evaluation**  
   - Measuring performance using metrics such as **R² Score, MAE, RMSE**.  
   - Visualizing actual vs predicted prices.
